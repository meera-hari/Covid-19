# Covid-19
Here I have taken a dataset on the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic data from the website https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.  
The Dataset has been loaded onto MS SQL Server for further exploration.  
The repository consists of all the SQL queries that have been used to get insights from the huge dataset, with detailed explanations for better understanding.
